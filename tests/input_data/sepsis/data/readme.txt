Description
===============================================================================
This real-life event log contains events of sepsis cases from a hospital. 
Sepsis is a life threatening condition typically caused by an infection. One 
case represents the pathway through the hospital.  The events were recorded
by the ERP system of the hospital. There are about 1000 cases with in total
15,000 events that were recorded for 16 different activities. Moreover, 
39 data attributes are recorded, e.g., the group responsible for the activity,
the results of tests and information from checklists.  Events and attribute 
values have been anonymized. The time stamps of events have been randomized, 
but the time between events within a trace has not been altered.
