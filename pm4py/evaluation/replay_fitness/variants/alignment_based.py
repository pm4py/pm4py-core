    Performs the basic alignment search, given a trace, a net and the costs of the \"best of the worst\".
    The costs of the best of the worst allows us to deduce the fitness of the trace.

    initial_marking: :class:`pm4py.objects.petri.net.Marking` initial marking in the Petri net
    final_marking: :class:`pm4py.objects.petri.net.Marking` final marking in the Petri net
    best_worst: cost of the best worst alignment of a trace (empty trace aligned to the model)
