    Converts a provided event log object into a Pandas dataframe. As a basis, an EventStream object is used.
    In case an EventLog object is given, it is first converted to an EventStream object.
    Within the conversion, the order is not changed, i.e., the order imposed by the iterator is used.

    Parameters
    -----------

    log :class:`pm4py.log.log.EventLog`
        Event log object, can either be an EventLog object, EventStream Object or Pandas dataframe

    parameters :class:`dict`
        Parameters of the algorithm (currently, this converter is parameter free)
