    Checks the conformance of the log using the provided temporal profile.

    Implements the approach described in:
    Stertz, Florian, JÃ¼rgen Mangler, and Stefanie Rinderle-Ma. "Temporal Conformance Checking at Runtime based on Time-infused Process Models." arXiv preprint arXiv:2008.07262 (2020).


    Parameters
    ---------------
    elog
        Event log
    temporal_profile
        Temporal profile
    parameters
        Parameters of the algorithm, including:
         - Parameters.ACTIVITY_KEY => the attribute to use as activity
         - Parameters.START_TIMESTAMP_KEY => the attribute to use as start timestamp
         - Parameters.TIMESTAMP_KEY => the attribute to use as timestamp
         - Parameters.ZETA => multiplier for the standard deviation

    Returns
    ---------------
    list_dev
        A list containing, for each trace, all the deviations.
        Each deviation is a tuple with four elements:
        - 1) The source activity of the recorded deviation
        - 2) The target activity of the recorded deviation
        - 3) The time passed between the occurrence of the source activity and the target activity
        - 4) The value of (time passed - mean)/std for this occurrence (zeta).
