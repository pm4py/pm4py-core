    '''
    This method finds a loop cut in the dfg.
    Implementation follows function LoopCut on page 190 of
    "Robust Process Mining with Guarantees" by Sander J.J. Leemans (ISBN: 978-90-386-4257-4)

    Basic Steps:
    1. merge all start and end activities in one group ('do' group)
    2. remove start/end activities from the dfg
    3. detect connected components in (undirected representative) of the reduced graph
    4. check if each component meets the start/end criteria of the loop cut definition (merge with the 'do' group if not)
    5. return the cut if at least two groups remain

    Parameters
    ----------
    dfg
        directly follows graph
    alphabet
        alphabet of the dfg / log
    start_activities
        multiset of start activities of the dfg / log
    end_activities
        multiset of end activities of the dfg / log

    Returns
    -------
        A list of sets of activities, i.e., forming a maximal loop cut
        None if no cut is found.
