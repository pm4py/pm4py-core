    Provided a Pandas dataframe, returns
    a list having as elements the activity-resources with the batches that are detected, divided in:
    - Simultaneous (all the events in the batch have identical start and end timestamps)
    - Batching at start (all the events in the batch have identical start timestamp)
    - Batching at end (all the events in the batch have identical end timestamp)
    - Sequential batching (for all the consecutive events, the end of the first is equal to the start of the second)
    - Concurrent batching (for all the consecutive events that are not sequentially matched)

    The approach has been described in the following paper:
    Martin, N., Swennen, M., Depaire, B., Jans, M., Caris, A., & Vanhoof, K. (2015, December). Batch Processing:
    Definition and Event Log Identification. In SIMPDA (pp. 137-140).

    Parameters
    -------------------
    log
        Dataframe
    parameters
        Parameters of the algorithm:
        - ACTIVITY_KEY => the attribute that should be used as activity
        - RESOURCE_KEY => the attribute that should be used as resource
        - START_TIMESTAMP_KEY => the attribute that should be used as start timestamp
        - TIMESTAMP_KEY => the attribute that should be used as timestamp
        - CASE_ID_KEY => the attribute that should be used as case identifier
        - MERGE_DISTANCE => the maximum time distance between non-overlapping intervals in order for them to be
            considered belonging to the same batch (default: 15*60   15 minutes)
        - MIN_BATCH_SIZE => the minimum number of events for a batch to be considered (default: 2)

    Returns
    ------------------
    list_batches
        A (sorted) list containing tuples. Each tuple contain:
        - Index 0: the activity-resource for which at least one batch has been detected
        - Index 1: the number of batches for the given activity-resource
        - Index 2: a list containing all the batches. Each batch is described by:
            # The start timestamp of the batch
            # The complete timestamp of the batch
            # The list of events that are executed in the batch
