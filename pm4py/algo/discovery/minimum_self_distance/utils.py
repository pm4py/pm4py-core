    '''
    This function derives the minimum self distance witnesses.
    The self distance of a in <a> is infinity, of a in <a,a> is 0, in <a,b,a> is 1, etc.
    The minimum self distance is the minimal observed self distance value in the event log.
    A 'witness' is an activity that witnesses the minimum self distance.
    For example, if the minimum self distance of activity a in some log L is 2, then,
    if trace <a,b,c,a> is in log L, b and c are a witness of a.

    Parameters
    ----------
    log
        Event Log to use
    msd
        Optional minimum self distance dictionary
    parameters
        Optional parameters dictionary

    Returns
    -------
    Dictionary mapping each activity to a set of witnesses.
