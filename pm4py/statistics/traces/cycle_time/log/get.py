    """
    Computes the cycle time starting from an event log or a trace object

    The definition that has been followed is the one proposed in:
    https://www.presentationeze.com/presentations/lean-manufacturing-just-in-time/lean-manufacturing-just-in-time-full-details/process-cycle-time-analysis/calculate-cycle-time/#:~:text=Cycle%20time%20%3D%20Average%20time%20between,is%2024%20minutes%20on%20average.

    So:
    Cycle time  = Average time between completion of units.

    Example taken from the website:
    Consider a manufacturing facility, which is producing 100 units of product per 40 hour week.
    The average throughput rate is 1 unit per 0.4 hours, which is one unit every 24 minutes.
    Therefore the cycle time is 24 minutes on average.

    Parameters
    ------------------
    log_or_trace
        Log or trace
    parameters
        Parameters of the algorithm, including:
        - Parameters.START_TIMESTAMP_KEY => the attribute acting as start timestamp
        - Parameters.TIMESTAMP_KEY => the attribute acting as timestamp

    Returns
    ------------------
    cycle_time
        Cycle time
